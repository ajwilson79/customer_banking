# Customer Banking System

## Overview

This Banking Application is a Python-based program designed to simulate basic banking operations. It allows users to create savings and certificate of deposit (CD) accounts, calculate interest earned over a specified period, and update account balances accordingly.

## Features

- **Account Creation**: Users can create two types of accounts:
  - **Savings Account**: A standard savings account where users can deposit funds and earn interest over time.
  - **CD Account (Certificate of Deposit)**: A fixed-term deposit account that typically offers a higher interest rate in return for the user agreeing to leave a lump-sum deposit untouched for a predetermined period.

- **Interest Calculation**: The application calculates the interest earned on the account balances over the specified term, based on the annual percentage rate (APR) provided by the user.

- **Balance Update**: After calculating the interest, the application updates the account balances, adding the interest earned during the term.

## Usage

To use the application, follow these steps:

1. Start the application by running the `customer_banking.py` script.
2. When prompted, enter the initial balance, APR, and term length (in months) for your savings account.
3. The application will display the interest earned and the updated balance for the savings account.
4. Next, enter the initial balance, APR, and term length for your CD account.
5. The application will calculate and display the interest earned and the updated balance for the CD account.

## Components

The application consists of the following components:

- `Account.py`: Defines the `Account` class with methods for setting the account balance and interest.

- `savings_account.py`: Contains the `create_savings_account` function, which creates a savings account, calculates interest, and updates the balance.

- `cd_account.py`: Contains the `create_cd_account` function, which creates a CD account, calculates interest, and updates the balance.

- `customer_banking.py`: The main script that interfaces with the user, prompts for account details, and displays the updated account information.
